# Three Body Problem visualizer
Visual test to see how the Three Body Problem actually looks like

Hence the personal curiosity to visually see how the "Three Body Problem" actually works in 3D (after watching the [TV show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13016388/) on Netflix) is the only reason of this repository's existence.

While the TBP is known as an unsovlable problem already, the code itself will be only for testing if I can reproduce the scene on the show. Those scenes to be checked out will be ...

1. Align of the 3 suns
   1. Visual Effects of other bodys and the main center planet.


### Precondition
I know ...
- Each the sun's radius are 4r, 2r, r.
- The mass of San-Ti's home planet is smaller than any other sun in the system.

I don't know ...
- The initial starting point's for all those planets in the system. (+ therefore the distance between each bodys are not presumable)
